# macOS code signing (self-signed, free)

The release pipeline signs the macOS binaries (`reminal` + `reminal-capture`)
with a **self-signed** code-signing certificate. This needs **no Apple Developer
account and costs nothing**.

## Why

macOS anchors a TCC permission (Screen Recording, Accessibility, …) to a binary's
**Designated Requirement** — for a signed binary that's a stable *identifier +
certificate*, not the per-build hash. So once the release is signed with a fixed
cert, a user grants the permission **once** and it survives every future upgrade.

This matters most for **Screen Recording**: sessions spawned by the background
host (the "+" in the Machines panel) run under launchd, *outside* your terminal's
permission grant, so they need reminal itself to hold the grant. Without stable
signing that grant resets on every version bump.

Not notarized — that's fine for how reminal is actually installed. `install.sh`
fetches the release tarball with `curl`, which does not attach the
`com.apple.quarantine` attribute the way a browser download does, so Gatekeeper
never gates it. (A `.tar.gz` downloaded through a browser *would* carry
quarantine and show one "unidentified developer" click-through; clearing that
needs notarization, which needs the paid account.)

## One-time setup

### 1. Create the certificate

Keychain Access → **Certificate Assistant ▸ Create a Certificate…**
- **Name:** `reminal-signing`  (this becomes the signing identity)
- **Identity Type:** Self Signed Root
- **Certificate Type:** Code Signing
- Check **"Let me override defaults"** and set a long **validity** (e.g. 3650+
  days) so the cert — and therefore the grant — doesn't expire out from under you.

Create it (it lands in the *login* keychain under *My Certificates*).

### 2. Export it

In Keychain Access, select the `reminal-signing` cert (with its private key) →
right-click → **Export…** → format **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)** →
set an export password. That password becomes `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`.

### 3. Add three GitHub Actions secrets

Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERT_P12` | `base64 -i reminal-signing.p12 \| pbcopy` — the base64 of the .p12 |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | the export password from step 2 |
| `MACOS_CERT_IDENTITY` | `reminal-signing` — the cert's Common Name |

That's it. The next tagged release signs with this cert. If the secrets are
absent the release still builds (binaries stay ad-hoc signed) — signing is
best-effort, see the "Sign (macOS…)" step in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Keeping it stable

Don't regenerate the cert. The whole benefit is that the identifier
(`sh.reminal` / `sh.reminal.capture`) + certificate stay constant across
releases. If you ever replace the cert, every user re-grants their permissions
once.
