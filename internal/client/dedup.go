// The reconnect scrollback-duplication bug: inline TUIs (Claude Code / Ink) repaint
// their ENTIRE visible transcript on a SIGWINCH resize, and because the app pre-wraps
// its own output (it emits each row already broken to the terminal width — verified: no
// emitted run ever exceeds the column count), each repaint re-emits a full copy of recent
// history, re-wrapped to the new width. Over a session of resizes/reconnects a whole
// transcript block can end up stamped many times over.
//
// dedupBlocks removes those re-emitted copies from rebuilt history. It works on whole
// PARAGRAPHS (maximal runs of non-blank rows), compared by their alphanumeric word
// sequence:
//
//   - WORD-level, not line-level, because the app re-wraps on resize: the 119-col copy
//     and the 58-col copy of a paragraph have different line breaks but identical words.
//   - Alphanumeric-only, so per-line chrome (the `▎` quote-bar, `---`, tree glyphs) —
//     which lands at wrap-dependent positions — is dropped and doesn't defeat the match.
//   - PARAGRAPH granularity (not sliding word-runs) so a single drifting line inside a
//     frame (a spinner, a token counter) only spares its own paragraph, and — crucially —
//     so we never collapse a short phrase that legitimately recurs. Real sessions repeat
//     text (successive drafts, retried commands); only a substantial VERBATIM paragraph
//     repeating is an unambiguous re-emit.
//
// It keeps the FIRST occurrence (the copy in its original scrollback position, preserving
// reading order) and drops later stamped copies. Conservative: a paragraph shorter than
// dedupMinParaWords is never deduped, so headings, prompts, and one-liners always survive.

// Frame-matched dedup: the second, width-INDEPENDENT half of the resize story.
//
// dedupBlocks above only collapses paragraphs re-emitted at the SAME width (identical
// word key). But an inline TUI repaints its frame on EVERY SIGWINCH — so a session
// that bounced between widths stamps copies of the CURRENT frame's content into
// committed scrollback re-wrapped differently each time. Those copies have identical
// words but different paragraph boundaries (blank/wrap structure shifts with width),
// so no paragraph-key scheme can pair them with each other.
//
// What CAN be paired is each copy against the live frame itself: every stale copy is,
// by definition, a re-emission of content the app is showing RIGHT NOW. So we match
// committed paragraphs against the current screen's word stream using word shingles
// (order-preserving 8-word windows — immune to wrapping, blank lines, and per-line
// chrome). A paragraph whose shingles are almost entirely present in the frame is a
// stale repaint copy: drop it. This is provably lossless — the dropped words are still
// painted, in the frame, at the snapshot's bottom; nothing the user could scroll to
// disappears. Content the app has scrolled PAST (no longer in its frame) is never
// touched, no matter how similar.
// dedupFrameShingle is the matched-run window: 8 words, below the run gate so
// every gated stretch contains several windows.

// truncation corrupts the LAST word of most committed rows ("unwrapped"→"unwrapp",
// "land"→"landg"), shattering runs to ~9 words — a higher gate let whole stale
// copies survive. Coincidence is further excluded where this matters most: the

// unrelated leftover rows (old welcome-box borders etc.). A whole-paragraph coverage

// word that lies inside an 8-word window also present (in order) in the reference
// stream, keep only maximal covered stretches of >= dedupFrameRunMin words, and mark
