// A session's shell should have the environment a terminal opened right now
// would have — not the one its launcher happened to inherit.
//
// On Unix reminal spawns a LOGIN shell for exactly this reason: it re-sources
// the profile chain, so PATH matches a freshly-opened terminal even when the
// agent was started by launchd with a bare environment. Windows has no such
// mechanism. A process inherits its parent's environment block, frozen at the
// moment that parent started, and nothing re-reads it.
//
// So a terminal that has been open since before an installer ran hands every
// reminal session it starts a stale PATH — and the session keeps handing it to
// every shell after that. Installing Claude Code and finding `claude` "not
// recognized" in session after session, while the registry plainly contains the
// entry, is that bug: the fix looked applied everywhere except where it counted.
//
// Explorer avoids this by rebuilding its environment on WM_SETTINGCHANGE, which
// is why a terminal opened fresh from the Start menu is fine. We rebuild ours
// from the same source Explorer reads: the persistent environment in the
// registry.
